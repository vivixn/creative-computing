	<h5>L’Arte del Gelato was born of my commitment to 
		producing an artisanal gelato in the Italian tradition – <br>
		a fresh, all-natural product made from the highest quality 
		ingredients. Industrial gelato is simply not our thing. <br>
		For instance, we’d never dream of using ready-made bases, 
		only what we make by hand. Therefore you won’t find harsh, <br>
		artificial colors in our gelaterie – just what comes naturally.
    We are inspired by the famous Italian gelaterie, born in the <br>
    early 70’s, that continue to draw customers from all over the 
    world. Just as they were symbols of the great economic rebirth <br>
    and promise of post-war Italy, we strive to symbolize an 
    authentic, completely natural, and of course, delicious product.<br>
