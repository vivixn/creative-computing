	<h5>The store was named after two homeless men for whom 
		Robert Rook did pro bono work, who asked that the ice cream <br>
		shop be named after them. Emack and Bolio were mascots of a 
		sort for the first store.The Bolios were a non-fraternal group <br>
		of raggedy, long-haired hippy-type college students that 
		attended Murray State University in Western Kentucky during <br>
		the 1970-75 period. They played sports together, entered "greek" 
		parades together, and partied together. They took their name <br>
		from an old movie with a line in it where the police yelled into 
		a building, "Come on out, you bolios, you". This account aligns <br>
		with Robert Rook's reference to two homeless men in 1975, one 
		of which was referred to as Bolio. <i>Click image to learn more!</i></h5>
