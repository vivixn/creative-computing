	<h5>Republic of Booza is the world‚Äôs first 
		modern booza brand. Booza is The Original Ice <br>
		Cream‚Ñ¢‚Äîthe first frozen dairy-based dessert from 
		which the ice creams we know today evolved. It was <br>
		developed alongside the technology for freezing 
		dairy, 500 years ago in the Levant region of the Eastern <br>
		Mediterranean. Booza distinguishes itself from other 
		ice creams by a soft elasticity that makes it smoother, <br>
		denser, and creamier. Because of this density, booza 
		packs more flavor per scoop than any other form of ice <br>
		cream.  It also melts more slowly, allowing it to be 
		served at a temperature that brings out full intensity <br>
		and complexity of flavor. <i>Click image to learn more!</i></h5>
