	<h5>Our first standalone scoop shop in Manhattan, 
		our Chelsea scoop shop opened in the fall of 2018. <br>
		It was also our first scoop shop to host Ice Cream 
		Happy Hour! Every Wednesday from 5pm to 7pm, we make <br>
		it easy to indulge your sweet tooth by offering happy 
		hour prices on our ice cream. Smack-dab in the middle <br>
		of the work week, Ice Cream Happy Hour gives you an 
		excuse to take that much-needed break. Our Chelsea <br>
		scoop shop is also the only shop to offer deluxe
		specialty cones, made in house, right there in front <br>
		of you (imagine that fresh waffle cone smell wafting
		through the shop). It's a bit of a trial right now; <br>
		if you love them, let us know! We're thinking about 
		offering them everywhere. <i>Click image to learn more!</i></h5>
